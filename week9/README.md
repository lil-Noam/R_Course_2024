This week on R course we learned about functions.
<br> <br>
This folder contains two files - analysis and functions <br><br>
functions.R contains the function descriptive_stats: <br>
input: a dataframe and two numerical variables, start and end (default valued as 1 and the length of the dataframe) <br>
output: a dataframe of basic descriptive summary of each column. for categorical variables it returns the number of samples from each category. for numerical variables it returns the minimum, maximum and mean values.
<br><br>
analysis.R generates data and loads the function from functions.R to analyze the generated dataset
